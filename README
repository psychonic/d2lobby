This plugin is largely obsolete (and completely unsupported) since Dota 2's port to Source2. There are also better approaches to much of the setup, creating/injecting fake lobbies rather than setting all internal data manually. Hopefully someone finds some use from this though.

Compiling requires multiple dependencies, including Metamod:Source, a pre-Source2 version of the dota branch of the Allied Modders hl2sdk, the SteamWorks SDK, and Jansson.
